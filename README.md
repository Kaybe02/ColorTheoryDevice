# ColorTheoryDeviceV1
An elementary device that teaches color theory.

## Objective and Purpose
This project was initially created as a hypothetical device that would be submitted to STEM learning and aid their STEM lab based learning initiatives. The device was created to teach elementary students color theory and how different colors mix with each other.

## Functionality of the Device

> When the device is turned ON it plays a loading sequence.

> The device allows the user to select any two buttons that are marked with its respective colors using LEDs.

> A loading animation would play on an LED display.

> The resultant color would display on a separate LED.

> The process will run on a LOOP until the device is turned off.

## Resources you will need

- An Arduino MEGA
- 6 LEDs (colors matching the colors you want)
- 1 RGB LED (to display the output)
- 1 OLED panel
- JUMPER cables

## Aproach to the contruction of the device

Initially it was planned to formulate a function that would calculate the resultant RGB code using a mathematical formula but instead since the no of output were limited for the purpose of teaching elementary students, we decided to use simple switch cases. To make the access times faster we used HASH FUNCTIONS.
